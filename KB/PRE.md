# Prerequisites
For Machine Learning mostly **Linear Algebra** and **Calculus I-III** are needed. In Linear Algebra, you should be good at eigenvectors and matrix operation. In Calculus, you should be quite comfortable with differentiation. You might also want to know basics of matrix differentiation before you start.

> Check out [Andrew Ng's suggestion](https://www.quora.com/I-do-not-have-strong-mathematics-background-what-should-I-learn-in-mathematics-to-be-able-to-master-Machine-Learning-and-AI/answer/Andrew-Ng) what to know from Math.

For being able to apply Math in case of Machine Learning, you'll also need to know basic programming. There's no recommended programming language, as you'll probably need to [switch between them from time to time](AIDL_KB/../../BAS.md#recommended-programming-language).

Some people are also arguing that Topology is necessary and having a Physics and Biology background could help. But they are not crucial to start.
